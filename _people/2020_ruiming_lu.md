bio: I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Professor Guangtao Xue and Professor Minglu Li. I obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) in 2020 from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute. My current research focuses on the reliability aspect of modern data centers. I work towards analyzing the failure characteristics of massively-deployed storage devices (e.g., NVMe SSD), understanding novel failure modes (e.g., the fail-slow failure), and designing practical fault-tolerant systems.
