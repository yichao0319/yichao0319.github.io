In this work, we seek to propose a novel near-field communication protocol, MagneComm, which utilizes Magnetic Induction (MI) signals emitted from CPUs and captured by magnetometers on mobile devices for communication. Since CPUs and magnetometers are readily available components in mobile devices, MagneComm eliminates the requirement for special hardware and complements existing near-field communication protocols by providing additional bandwidth. We systematically analyze the characteristics of magnetic signals of CPUs and facilitate MagneComm with one-way communication, full-duplex communication, and multi-transmitter schemes in accordance with the hardware availability on devices. We prototype MagneComm on both laptops and smartphones. Extensive evaluation results show that MagneComm achieves up to 110 bps within 10 cm.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project-magnecomm-cover-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project-magnecomm-cover-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project-magnecomm-cover-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project-magnecomm-cover.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="publication">Publication</h2> <div hidden=""> <a class="citation" href="#pan-mobicom17">Hao Pan et al., “MagneComm: Magnetometer-Based Near-Field Communication,” in <i>ACM International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom)</i> (ACM, 2017), 167–79, https://doi.org/10.1145/3117811.3117824.</a> <a class="citation" href="#xue-tmc21">Guangtao Xue et al., “MagneComm+: Near-Field Electromagnetic Induction Communication with Magnetometer,” <i>IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</i>, 2021, 1–1, https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2021.3133481.</a> </div> </body></html>
