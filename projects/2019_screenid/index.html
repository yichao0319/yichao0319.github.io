Recently, however, attacks against QR codes have been reported that attackers can capture a QR code of the victim and replay it to achieve a fraudulent transaction or intercept private information, just before the original QR code is scanned.</p> <p>In this study, we enhance the security of a QR code by identifying its authenticity. We propose ScreenID, which embeds a QR code with information of the screen which displays it, thereby the QR code can reveal whether it is reproduced by an adversary or not. In ScreenID, PWM frequency of screens is exploited as the unique screen fingerprint. To improve the estimation accuracy of PWM frequency, ScreenID incorporates a model for the interaction between the camera and screen in the temporal and spatial domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScreenID can differentiate screens of different models, types, and manufacturers, thus improve the security of QR codes.</p> <hr> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>The QRCode system works in a straightforward way. As shown in the flowchart in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fig.1</code>, payment transactions begin with the generation of a legal QR code, which includes the ID of the user in the application, e.g., the AliPay account, a time-stamp, and the secret transaction information in the form of an encrypted token. The user then presents the QR code to the cashier to have it scanned into the transaction system, together with other transaction information such as total amount and currency type. On the server side, the merchant extracts the token from QR code, obtains the user ID from the token and then accesses the database maintained by the company to retrieve the stored secret of the payer. This secret is then converted into a new token for verification. As long as the token is deemed valid, the transaction proceeds.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project-screenid-authentication-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project-screenid-authentication-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project-screenid-authentication-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project-screenid-authentication.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 1 A flowchart of a typical QRCode system for mobile transaction. </div> <p>However, the above-mentioned transaction process is far from secure. Recently, researchers have reported that a QRCode system is susceptible to the Synchronized Token Lifting and Spending (STLS) attack and other similar attacks <a href="#refer-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In this attack, the adversary first acquires an image of the QR code displayed on the victim’s device, when the victim is showing the QR code to the cashier, then the adversary replays the stolen QR code for another transaction, which we call fraudulent transaction. To ensure the success of such an attack, the adversary should also finish the transaction before the legitimate scanning process from the cashier.</p> <p>To address this issue, we sought to enhance the security of the QRCode system by identifying the authenticity of a QR code. We propose ScreenID, which embeds a QR code with information of the screen that is displaying it, thereby the generated QR code can reveal whether the screen is corresponding to it. In ScreenID, we utilize the pulse width modulation (PWM) frequency of screens as the unique screen fingerprint. PWM frequency makes a good candidate for screen fingerprint for the reason that it is adjusted to different value by screen manufacturers. Even for the same manufacture, the PWM frequency shows variances due to the variations in the manufacturing processes.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fig.2(a)(c)(e)</code> shows the black and white bands caused by the interaction between LCD screen flicker and the rolling shutter. Note the lack of variation in the width and angle of the bands despite variations in the distance and angle between the camera and screen. This indicates the estimates of flicker frequency vary only as a function of rolling shutter speed. By contrast, the bands in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fig.2(b)(d)(f)</code> from an OLED screen varied in terms of width and angle, depending on the position of the screen. This can be attributed to the fact that each pixel in an OLED screen is controlled by an LED light source and the PWM cycle of each row is asynchronous.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project-screenid-photo-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project-screenid-photo-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project-screenid-photo-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project-screenid-photo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 2 Images of LCD and OLED screens captured using a camera. The position and direction of the screens were varied. </div> <p>Therefore, the key idea of ScreenID is to model the screen-camera interaction in temporal as well as spatial domain. The system needs to parse out the PWM frequency of the screen from the captured picture regardless of any rotation angle and capturing distance. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fig. 3</code> illustrates the architecture of ScreenID system, comprising two parts: encoding by the sender (smartphone screen) and decoding by the receiver (camera). For decoding process, the system first captured a single image to determine QR code position, then captured a video for real-time PWM frequency extraction. The frequency extraction process includes four steps: contour extraction, multi-frame concatenation, frequency extraction and verification.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project-screenid-overview-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project-screenid-overview-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project-screenid-overview-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project-screenid-overview.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 3 overview of ScreenID system. </div> <hr> <h2 id="contribution">Contribution</h2> <p>We verified the efficacy of a ScreenID prototype using 50 screens under a variety of camera settings and environmental conditions.
