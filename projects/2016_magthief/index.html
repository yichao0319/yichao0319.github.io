This paper outlines a novel approach to the extraction of detailed app usage information based on analysis of the electromagnetic (EM) signals emitted from mobile devices when executing app-related tasks. Note that this type of EM leakage becomes high-complex when multiple apps are used simultaneously and is subject to interference from geomagnetic signals generated by device movement. This paper proposes a deep learning-based multi-label classification system to identify apps and in-app services based on magnetometer readings. The proposed MAGTHIEF system uses accelerometer and gyroscope data to cancel out the offset in geomagnetic signals followed by an elaborate deep region convolution neural network (DRCNN) to differentiate among multiple apps and the corresponding inapp services. Experiments on 50 apps demonstrated the efficacy of MAGTHIEF in identifying multiple apps and in-app services, achieving high average macro F1 scores of 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. MAGTHIEF also achieved time duration accuracy of 89.5% in recognizing app trajectory in the real-world scene</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project-magthief-cover-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project-magthief-cover-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project-magthief-cover-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project-magthief-cover.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="publications">Publications</h2> <div hidden=""> <a class="citation" href="#ji-tmc21">Xiaoyu Ji et al., “No Seeing Is Also Believing: Electromagnetic-Emission-Based Application Guessing Attacks via Smartphones,” <i>IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</i>, 2021, 1–1, https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2021.3092209.</a> <a class="citation" href="#pan-secon21">Hao Pan et al., “MagThief: Stealing Private App Usage Data on Mobile Devices via Built-in Magnetometer,” in <i>IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking, (SECON)</i> (IEEE, 0AD), 1–9, https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON52354.2021.9491601.</a> <a class="citation" href="#cheng-asiaccs19">Yushi Cheng et al., “MagAttack: Guessing Application Launching and Operation via Smartphone,” in <i>ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (AsiaCCS)</i> (ACM, 2019), 283–94, https://doi.org/10.1145/3321705.3329817.</a> <a class="citation" href="#zhu-ubicomp16">Zhuangdi Zhu et al., “MagAttack: Remote App Sensing with Your Phone,” in <i>ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and International Symposium On Wearable Computers (UbiComp/ISWC Poster)</i>, ed. by Paul Lukowicz et al.
