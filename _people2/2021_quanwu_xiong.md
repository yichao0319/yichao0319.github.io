bio: I'm a master student who has a deep love for anime and gaming. In my spare time, you can often find me immersed in the world of animated series or enjoying the challenges of various video games. I'm not just a solo player, though—I thrive on building connections and making new friends. My enthusiasm for socializing extends to my active participation in team activities. I believe in the power of teamwork and am always eager to contribute to a positive team atmosphere.
