I join Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a tenure-track Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in 2018. I received my B.S. and M.S. in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University in 2004 and 2006, respectively. I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin in 2015. Prior to joining SJTU, I spent a year as a Researcher in Huawei Future Network Theory Lab in Hong Kong and then worked as a Chief Scientist in Hauoli LLC. <br>

My research interests focus on networked systems and span the areas of mobile computing, wireless networking, and cyber-security.
